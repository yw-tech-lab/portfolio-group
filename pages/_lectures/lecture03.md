## Recap
Today we went through the idea of selectors (with Esther), learned some tips and tricks (from Beck) and worked a bit more on the FroYo CSS.

We also have our first client, Khalilah Lyons, who wants us to build a website for her consulting business. Her slides are available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E00i5GjdMnQAMWNyRM7yi_dLBiRAO9iu/view?usp=sharing). She also has a second website here (for another business she runs) called [Candidly Connecting](https://www.candidlyconnecting.com/).

We are still figuring out logistics regarding budget and timeline, but I think it could be a great way to gets some hand-on, real-world experience while practicing our coding and design skills.

## Goals for the week
* Continue working on the Homepage CSS
* See if you can start working on the mobile version
