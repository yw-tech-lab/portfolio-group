## Recap

During our debrief at the end, folks mentioned that it would be useful to:
* Do some review of HTML & CSS, and to create some cheat sheets
* Talk a bit about potential next steps in terms of jobs / careers. 
Wonderful ideas! We're on it and will work on compiling some resources.

## Goals for the week
If you have time before next Thursday: Please try implementing the CSS for the FroYo homepage. No need to get it perfect...just give it a shot!
