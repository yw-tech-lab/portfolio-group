Today we did two different activities:
1. We generated an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p1l3ELTUWgYsS2iibEa9y8XMtWk0wvoa0B7_F0YjOws/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Interview Guide</a> for our client
2. We also worked on the "gray panel" in the yogurt mockup with Esther and practiced using CSS Grid
