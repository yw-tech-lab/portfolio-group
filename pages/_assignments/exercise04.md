> ## Learning Goals
> 1. Practicing downloading & unzipping files, and editing them using Visual Studio Code.
> 2. Accessing the LinkedIn Learning videos.
> 3. Practicing using flexbox
> 4. Practicing using media queries

If you have time this week, we've devised an activity -- using flexbox and media queries -- for you to try. Please do the following.

## 1. Background Readings / Exercises
Please review the [flexbox resourses](../css-reference/flexbox/) on the portfolio website. Depending on how much time you have: 
  * Try watching some of the LinkedIn learning videos. These particular videos are a very technical, so if you're not finding these videos helpful, just skip it for now.
  * Try playing a few levels of the Flexbox Froggy game
  * Briefly scan the simplified cheatsheet

Please also review the [media query resources](../css-reference/media-queries/) on the portfolio website. 
  * Try watching some of the LinkedIn learning videos
  * Glance at the sample CodePen

## 2. Try the activity
1) Download the exercise files and unzip them somewhere that you will be able to find later:

<a class="nu-button" href="../course-files/homework/exercise04.zip" target="_blank">
    Exercise 04 Files <i class="fas fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</a>

2) Open the `exercise04` folder in Visual Studio Code by clicking `File > Add Folder to Workspace...` (using the File menu at the top, left-hand corner of your screen).
* Note that after you load your folder, sometimes the files are hidden, so make sure you click the icon that looks like two pieces of paper in the upper, left-hand menu of Visual Studio code.

3) Open the `menu-activity` folder, and try to write the HTML and CSS code to make something that resembles <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GL-lbpkOohBGlrEzc1PyzdKYU1G3tGDj/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this video</a>.

4) If you get stuck, some options:
* You can review this video from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z0K6SNXwjRyRv4OMd8fKSy90hJ_d3LUQ/view" target="_blank">Week 2</a> (starting around minute 25:00).
* You can attend office hours
* You can look at the answers, located in the `answers-try-not-to-peek-until-youve-tried-it` folder.
